# BkdiffBackup

This is a *vey simple* backup software for MS Windows.
I had the following design goals:

- only one backup strategy, namely *backward-differences* is supported, which is 
  the only strategy that makes sense for backup-to-disc.
  Differentials or incrementals are from the tape backup era.
- backups should be parsable with a standard file browser
- no encryption of backups or additional security; security ans user acces controll should be handeled by the file system
  and networks share
